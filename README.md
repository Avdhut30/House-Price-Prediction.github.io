# House-Price-Prediction

# Abstract

House price forecasting is an important topic of real estate. The literature attempts to derive useful knowledge from historical data of property markets. Machine learning techniques are applied to analyze historical property transactions in India to discover useful models for house buyers and sellers. Revealed is the high discrepancy between house prices in the most expensive and most affordable suburbs in the city of Mumbai. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the Multiple Linear Regression that is based on mean squared error measurement is a competitive approach.
The accuracy of the prediction is evaluated by checking the root square and root mean square error scores of the training model. The test is performed after applying the required pre-processing methods and splitting the data into two parts. However, one part will be used in the training and the other in the test phase. We have also presented a binning strategy that improved the accuracy of the models.
